# Mass Action Kinetics Simulation

## Overview

`mass-action-kinetics-simulation` provides Python tools for simulating chemical reaction kinetics using both differential equation models and stochastic approaches. The repository includes implementations for Euler-Forward integration and Gillespie's algorithm, allowing for the study of reaction dynamics under various conditions.

## Features

- **Differential Equation Model:** Simulate reaction kinetics using the Euler-Forward Integrator to model time traces of chemical species.
- **Stochastic Model:** Use Gillespie's algorithm to simulate stochastic reactions and observe the effects of different reaction volumes.
